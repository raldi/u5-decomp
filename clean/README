Recreated source code.

Must produce as close to possible the original binary files when compiled
with Microsoft C Compiler 5.1 for DOS.

Procedure:

Somehow acquire Microsoft C Compiler 5.1 (this exact version) and install it
under DosBox. Set up the paths in DosBox, if you installed in C:\,

    SET PATH=C:\bin
    SET LIB=C:\lib
    SET INCLUDE=C:\include

Write a C file 'scratch.c' with an empty main function and a sketch of the
function you're reverse-engienering.

Compile your code in DosBox with

    cl -Ox -Fa scratch.c

It will emit scratch.asm and scratch.exe. Eyeball scratch.asm against Ghidra's
decompile of the OVL or EXE file until you're happy.

Start with Ghidra's suggestion for the C source. It's probably not going to
produce matching output out of the box, the compiler is very finicky and
Ghdira's output is so-so. Read the original assembly to figure out exactly
what was happening in the original code.
