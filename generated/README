Initial source code mostly as it was output from Ghidra's C code
decompilation.

Try to keep the files in this directory mostly intact. Changes that rely on
mechanical search & replace like reassigning function names is okay, but don't
touch the raw memory address stuff. Mistakes are bound to happen when
rewriting the annotated codes, so these files can serve as a backup where the
original machine-generated logic can be re-checked.
